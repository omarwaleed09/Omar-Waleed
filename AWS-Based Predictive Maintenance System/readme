# AWS-Based Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview

This project was developed by our team as part of the **Egypt Digital Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**.  
We built a predictive maintenance system that uses real-time data and machine learning to forecast equipment failures and send alerts automatically.

## Objectives

- Predict potential equipment failures before they occur  
- Enable real-time data ingestion and processing  
- Automate model training, deployment, and notifications

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model**  
  Trained an XGBoost model using historical maintenance data.

- **MLOps Pipeline**  
  Used MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.

- **Real-Time Integration**  
  - Ingested data via AWS S3 and EC2  
  - Deployed model with AWS SageMaker  
  - Triggered live alerts using AWS Lambda and SNS

## Tools & Technologies

- **AWS S3** – data storage  
- **AWS EC2** – compute environment for preprocessing  
- **AWS SageMaker** – model training and deployment  
- **AWS Lambda** – real-time inference and alert logic  
- **AWS SNS** – alert distribution  
- **MLflow** – experiment tracking  
- **Python** – development language  
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `XGBoost`

## How It Works

1. Sensor data is uploaded to AWS S3  
2. Preprocessing happens on EC2  
3. The trained XGBoost model is hosted on SageMaker  
4. Lambda functions monitor for failures and invoke predictions  
5. SNS sends alerts to subscribed endpoints

## Contributions

This project was a team effort in the DEPI program.  
We collaborated on design, development, deployment, and testing.
