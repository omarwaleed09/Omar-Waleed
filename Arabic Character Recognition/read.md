# 📝 Arabic Character Recognition

A machine learning project for recognizing handwritten Arabic characters — clean, simple, and focused on results.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- Preprocessing and normalization of Arabic character data  
- Model training with:
  - ✅ Neural Networks (with k-fold cross-validation)
  - ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Performance evaluation:
  - 📊 Accuracy
  - 📉 Confusion Matrix
- Final prediction on unseen data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` — Arabic character dataset  
- `./` — main Jupyter notebook with full pipeline
