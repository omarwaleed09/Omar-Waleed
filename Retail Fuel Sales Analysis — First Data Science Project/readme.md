# Retail Fuel Sales Analysis â€” First Data Science Project

This is my first project in data science.  
I used real-world datasets on sales, weather, and fuel pricing to analyze patterns and build predictive models.

## What I did

- Cleaned the data:
  - Removed duplicates
  - Handled missing values
  - Merged datasets meaningfully
- Explored the data and visualized relationships  
- Queried specific patterns and trends in sales, pricing, and weather  
- Split the data into training and testing sets  
- Trained and evaluated machine learning models

## Models used

- KMeans (for clustering)  
- DecisionTreeRegressor  
- LinearRegression  

## Tools used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## What I learned

- How to clean and combine multiple datasets  
- How to explore and understand real business data  
- How to build and test regression models  
- How clustering can be used to extract new insights

## Future improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning  
- Use more advanced models like XGBoost or RandomForest  
- Build a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash  
- Deploy and share the project online

This project helped me apply core data science techniques to real, structured data for the first time.
