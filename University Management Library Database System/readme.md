# College Project - Database System with GUI

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a course at college.  
It demonstrates the full cycle of building a simple database-driven application, from design to implementation.

## Project Components

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
  We designed an ERD to model the system's entities and relationships clearly.

- **Database Structure**  
  We created the database schema using SQL, including:  
  - Table definitions  
  - Primary and foreign keys  
  - Constraints and relationships  

- **Graphical User Interface**  
  A simple interactive GUI was developed using **C#**.  
  The GUI allows users to:  
  - View data  
  - Add and update records  
  - Interact with the database easily

## Technologies Used

- **SQL** – for creating and managing the database  
- **C#** – for building the desktop application interface  
- **Visual Studio** – for GUI development  
- **Any relational DBMS** (e.g., SQL Server or MySQL)

## Team

This project was built collaboratively as part of a college course.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Import or run the SQL script to create the database  
3. Open the C# solution in Visual Studio
